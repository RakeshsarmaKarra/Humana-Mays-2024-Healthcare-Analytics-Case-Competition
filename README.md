# üè• Bridging the Preventive Care Gap: Predicting Unengaged Medicare Advantage Members

## Project Overview
This project was developed as part of the Humana-Mays Healthcare Analytics Case Competition 2024. It focuses on identifying unengaged Medicare Advantage members and devising strategies to enhance preventive care engagement.                                                                                              

üöÄ **Goal**: Develop a predictive model to identify unengaged Medicare Advantage members and improve preventive care outreach.                                  
üîç **Impact**: Enhancing patient engagement can reduce healthcare costs and improve overall health outcomes.

- What are the behaviors and underlying barriers among members in LPPO plans who are not engaging in preventive care with a PCP?                                     
- Which members are not likely to complete a preventive PCP visit in the current calendar year?                                                                 
- How can primary care physicians and specialists address low patient engagement in preventive care?
